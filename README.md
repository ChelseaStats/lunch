## Advertise

Please speak to @kutf on twitter to advertise on this page - advertising is limited to local companies to Cheltenham and can be for as little as £50 pa (to cover minimal costs of the service) to fill one of the squares with your content.

You can also hijack the randomiser for a week for £100 - i.e. every day your venue will be selected.
